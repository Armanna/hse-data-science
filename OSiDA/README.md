## 📄 Abstract

This project investigates the use of **Lazy Formal Concept Analysis (FCA)** with **Pattern Structures** for binary classification on the *Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)* dataset.  

The work includes:

- Implementation of the **Lazy FCA baseline classifier** using interval pattern structures  
- Comparison with standard machine learning models (kNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Development of an improved **directional Max–Min support FCA classifier**  

Results show that the enhanced FCA model achieves **high predictive accuracy** while maintaining **superior interpretability**, which is especially important in medical diagnostic applications where transparent reasoning is required.
